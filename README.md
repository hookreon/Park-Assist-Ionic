### Roadmap

> [Park Assist](https://parkassist.herokuapp.com/) began as a desktop application in need of a mobile version on a tight deadline. Our team was tasked with taking the legacy codebase and porting to mobile. Given that the original web application was written in AngularJS, we decided to use Ionic for its compatibility with original source code. 

> The switch to mobile required an overhaul of the UI. Below is the a screengrab of the original UI:

Below is the updated mobile UI:

## Usage

> Before working in `Park-Assist-Ionic`, look over the README files in `dbScrape` and `splendid-simi-dev`. These folder contain information about servers that support the mobile application, and the project won't work without these servers running.
